# Setup for Windows

Windows is a little bit more complicated to setup your virtual enviorment for. 
If you are using an IDE like pycharm, you shouldn't have to worry about this process.

I would recomend using a bash-like command line interface that would work well with windows or install
a WSL (windows subsystem for linux) Virtual Machine. Use [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
and follow the instructions to install wsl. This will allow you to use The linux install instructions [here](Linux.md)
