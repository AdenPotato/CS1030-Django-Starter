# Setting up Your Django Enviroment

First we will setup our Django Enviorment for the class.
You will install Python3 on your system, this will require 
you to use your prefered Systems install method. We will setup 
an enviorment called a Virtual Enviorment.

# What is a Virtual Enviorment?

You can think of a virtual enviroment as a python enviorment 
that is specific for your project. This makes it so dependencies of 
other projects don't mix with this project.
